# Project Kala

This AI model generates Chinese sentences based on the English keywords and [HSK level](https://www.vu.edu.au/victoria-business-confucius-institute-vbci/chinese-language-tests-competitions/hsk-language-proficiency-tests) keyed-in by the users. Our goal is to help second-language teachers to generate personalized and engaging stories based on the learner's HSK skills level and interesting topics.

## Description

This project is submitted for [2023 Cohere Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-hackathon). Our team fine-tunes the [Cohere's Generative AI model](https://cohere.ai/) to help second-language teachers around the world create engaging and personalized stories for the learners based on their skills level and interesting topics.
